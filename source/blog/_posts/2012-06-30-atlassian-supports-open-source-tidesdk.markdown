[Atlassian](http://www.atlassian.com) strongly believes in open source software. They support and contribute to the open source community in a number of ways â€” supplying their own code, supporting other projects by donating software, and sponsoring Java User Groups.

We are both extremely pleased and grateful that Atlassian has descided to support our open source effort with TideSDK. As a result, we have received the following assistance:

* JIRA OnDemand 2000 Users (Community)
* GreenHopper for JIRA OnDemand 2000 Users (Community)
* Bonfire for JIRA OnDemand 2000 Users (Community)
* FishEye/Crucible OnDemand 2000 Users (Community)
* Bamboo OnDemand 100 Remote Agents, Unlimited Jobs (Community)
* Confluence OnDemand 2000 Users (Community)

In fact, we've already been making great use of the software. [nazcasistemas](https://github.com/nazcasistemas) has imported the legacy of Titanium Desktop for reference while [dubcanada](https://github.com/dubcanada) has reviewed the issue history for issues we are bringing forward for categorization and to align these with our release goals.

Many thanks Atlassian for your generous support!
